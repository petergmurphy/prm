## Overview

The Puppet Runtime Manager (PRM) is a tool for validating Puppet content and for running arbitrary development/maintenance tasks against that content.

Check out the [docs site](https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/docs/prm/) for more information.

> :warning: PRM is currently in an EXPERIMENTAL phase and feedback is encouraged via [prm/discussions](https://github.com/puppetlabs/prm/discussions) and starting a `feedback` post.

## Installing

While PRM is in early release, we provide an archive and a simple script to unpack it.
When we move closer to a full release we will add a platform specific installer.
Use the `install.[ps1|sh]` script, depending upon your OS:

### Unix Systems

```bash
curl -L https://pup.pt/prm/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows Systems

```ps
iex "&{ $(irm https://pup.pt/prm/install.ps1); Install-Prm }"
```

This will install the latest release of PRM to `~/.puppetlabs/prm`.

<!-- ![install_prm](docs/_resources/install_and_export_path.gif) -->

> :warning: If you do not use the install script and are extracting the archive yourself, be sure to use the fully qualified path to `~/.puppetlabs/prm` on *nix or `$HOME/.puppetlabs/prm` on Windows when you set your `PATH` environment variable.

A version of the product, with telemetry functionality disabled, is available too.
See [here](#installing-telemetry-free-version) for instructions on how to install it.

## Locally host documentation site

The DevX documentation site can be locally hosted and changes made to the markdown files inside of the `docs/md/content` directory will
be visible on the site.

### Prerequisites

Essential software that will need to be installed to run the documentation site locally:

- Git version control
- Hugo extended version
- Nodejs and NPM

### Install site

To install the documentation site run the following command from the root of this project:

```bash
./docs.sh
```

This will install and run the documentation site. The site can be found at `http://localhost:1313/devx`. All updates will to the
`docs/md/content` directory will hot reload the site.

To stop the running `ctrl + c` in the terminal window in which it is running.

### Run site

Commands to run the site locally:
```bash
# Run without draft pages being displayed
./docs.sh
```
or

```bash
# Run with draft pages being displayed
./docs.sh -D
```

## Installing Telemetry Free Version

We gather telemetry data to provide insights into how our products are being used.

The following data is collected:

- Version of application in use
- OS / platform of the device
- What commands have been invoked (including command args)
- Any errors that occurred when running the application

We understand that there will be some users who prefer to have no telemetry data sent.
For those users, we offer a version of PRM with the telemetry functionality disabled.

To install:
### Unix Systems

```bash
curl -L https://pup.pt/prm/install.sh | sh -s -- --no-telemetry
```

### Windows Systems

```ps
iex "&{ $(irm https://pup.pt/prm/install.ps1); Install-Prm -NoTelemetry }"
```

This will install the latest release of PRM, without telemetry functionality, to `~/.puppetlabs/prm`.
